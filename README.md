# CAT-DOG-imageClassifier
Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.
In general terms, a typical machine learning code for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras might work as follows:

Data Preparation: The code would likely involve loading and preprocessing the image data. This may include tasks such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

Model Definition: The code would define the architecture of the neural network model using the Keras API. This involves specifying the layers, activation functions, and other parameters of the model.

Model Training: The code would then compile the model and train it using the training data. This involves specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics to monitor, and then calling the fit method to train the model.

Model Evaluation: After training, the code would evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set to assess its accuracy and other metrics.

Prediction: Finally, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
